A brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered

	Some of the major difficulties we encountered were trying to figure 
	out how came from tasks 2-4. The main issue we had with task 3 was 
        that we didn't know what needed to be modified in exec.c. It finally
        became clear when the lab 3 description file was added and we were 
        able to see that a higher priority needed to be set to a new process.
