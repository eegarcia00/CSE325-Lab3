Lab 3
For task 1: We added the int cps() function call to the following files:
	    defs.h, user.h, syscall.h, sysproc.c, syscall.c, proc.c, and usys.S.
            Also we added the file ps.c to call cps() and added it to the Makefile.
            Then we ran the test as instructed.

For task 2: We created nice.c in order to change the nice value by allowing it
            to accept 2 arguments, pid and priority. In addition to making nice.c
            function properly we created a function change_priority() so that we could
            call it in nice.c. This function call was added to proc.c. We also added the 
            given lab3test.c to our project, and made sure it was also included in our Makefile.
            Then we ran the test as instructed.   

For task 3: In task 3 we made sure to add a high priority statement to exec.c. 
            Another thing that was done was modifying lab3test.c. We added wait()
            in order for the the parent process to wait for the child process to be
            done. Then we ran the test as instructed.

For task 4:
